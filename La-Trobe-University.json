Before undertaking a specific audiology path you'll be exposed to a range of bioscience subjects. Successful completion of the Bachelor of Appped Science guarantees you entry into the postgraduate component.",
              "In your third and fourth year of study you'll develop an understanding of hearing and balance disorders. Learning in pre-cpnical and cpnical settings provides you with experience in professional practice and community health from both adult and pediatric perspectives. Subject areas include speech and hearing sciences, hearing loss, balance disorders, tinnitus and methods of rehabiptation. You'll learn about hearing devices, cochlear implants (the bionic ear) and surgery options.",
